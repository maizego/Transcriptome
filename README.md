**Introduction**
====================================
The expression level in DAP15 kernel of the 368 association panel was quantified based on RNA-seq. Read counts for each gene were calculated and scaled according to RPKM. After RPKM normalization, all genes with a median expression level larger than zero for each sample were included, and the overall distribution among 368 lines of expression levels for each gene is normalized using a normal quantile transformation.
